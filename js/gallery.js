/* Instructions

1. Create a web page using HTML and CSS. The page should have a title, a search box, and a place where a photo gallery will be placed. Make sure it is responsive.

2. Add the provided images to the gallery using the design in the gallery_mockup.png file.

3. Find a jQuery plugin for creating a photo gallery or write your own script. The gallery must include the ability to click on photos and view them in a lightbox (see the photo_lightbox.png file for the design). The gallery should also include support for additional media types like YouTube videos.

4. Add text captions to the images when viewed in the lightbox. See the photo_lightbox.png file for the design.

5. Add back and forward buttons when the lightbox is visible to switch between photos. Also, add keyboard navigation for browsing photos.

6. Implement the search box at the top of the page that filters photos based on the captions. The photos should filter in real-time as you type. Add animation effects when filtering the gallery of photos.

7. Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.

8. You should also check for issues with your JavaScript code using JSHint, linked in the Project Resources.
